<h1>Creating scripts</h1>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
A <strong>script</strong> is a collection of customisations known as 
<strong>script items</strong>. You can have a single script for all your 
customisations, or do each one in a different script, or something in between -
it's up to you.
</p>
<p>
Create a script using the <strong>New</strong>
button in the <strong>Scripting</strong> window. Then edit it using the 
<strong>Edit</strong> button to bring up the script editor.
</p>
<h2>Script editor</h2>
<p>
In the script editor you can add or delete items as well as edit each item. 
You can also enable or disable individual items. When you've made any changes 
(such as adding a script item, disabling one, or editing some code within one)
you need to click <strong>Save</strong> before they will take effect. It's also
possible to click <strong>Revert</strong>, which will undo your changes and
return to the previous saved version.
</p>
<p>
You can only enable or disable the whole script when there aren't any unsaved
changes. (In other words, save it first, then enable it.)
</p>
<h2>Script items</h2>
<p>
Create script items by clicking <strong>Add item</strong>, choosing the type of 
item from the dropdown, and then altering the settings as needed. 
</p>
<p>
You can change the settings later by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> button 
next to the relevant item, or delete the item altogether using the 
<strong>Delete</strong> button.
</p>
<h2>Code blocks</h2>
<p>
Along with the settings dialog, most script items require you to type in blocks 
of code, which you can edit directly in the script editor window. For example,
the 'Command' item uses the settings dialog to specify the name of the command
and any parameters, but you use the code block to specify what actually happens
when you type that command.
</p>
<h3>IRC commands</h3>
<p>
You can type IRC commands into the code block. If the script item includes
parameters or other variables (these will be displayed just above the code block), 
you can include these in the IRC command as <tt>${variable}</tt>.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
/msg ${nick} You smell of cheese.
</pre>
<p>
Technically, the contents of <tt>${}</tt> can be any Java expression, but it is
most straightforward to use simple variable names.
</p>
<p>
If you want to do 'normal talking' in your script (i.e. exactly the same as if
you just typed text in the window), you can't do this just with plain text as
this will cause errors. Instead, put <tt>/say</tt> in front. leafChat automatically
works out where to send the text.
</p>
<pre>
/say So I was wondering...
</pre>
<h3>Java code</h3>
<p>
You can also include Java code in the code block. Any line that doesn't begin
with a / is interpreted as Java code. You can mix IRC commands with the Java code,
too. For instance:
</p>
<pre>
// List of cheeses
String[] cheeses={"Cheddar","Gorgonzola","Stilton"};
// Pick a cheese at random
String random=cheeses[(int)(Math.random()*cheeses.length)];
// Now send the message using the random cheese
/msg ${nick} You smell of ${random}.
</pre>
<p>As you can see, standard Java <tt>//</tt> comments can be used.</p>
<p>One final Java extension for advanced users is that you can use double 
square brackets to access
one of the singleton classes leafChat provides. These are documented in the
<a href="../pluginapi/index.html">plugin API</a>. (In scripts you have access
to the full leafChat public API from all plugins, without needing to import
anything or use full names.)</p>
<pre>
[[UI]].showUserError(null,"User error","The user has done something wrong");
</pre>

<h3>Code errors</h3>
<p>
When you save your script, it will be checked for syntax errors. (These are 
only likely to happen if you use Java code.) If there are errors,
you can choose to disable the script and save it, or to cancel (not save). You
can't save a script and leave it enabled if there are errors. If you want to
do so, try disabling the individual item which causes errors.
</p>
<p>
leafChat tries to guess the approximate lines on which the error occurred. 
These will be highlighted in yellow on the script item which caused the error.
Sometimes it might guess the wrong line, so be careful. Similarly, the error
message is displayed at the bottom of the item, but this might sometimes be
wrong or unhelpful. 
</p>

<h2>Script items</h2>
<p>
There are four types of script item:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Command</strong> - create new IRC commands.</li>
<li><strong>Menu item</strong> - add new options to right-click menus.</li>
<li><strong>Event</strong> - create automatic reactions to data received from IRC.</li>
<li><strong>Variable</strong> - set up a variable for use in other script items.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Command</h3>
<p>
The <strong>Command</strong> item lets you create a new IRC command, such as
<tt>/cheese</tt>. You can control what happens when you type this command.
</p>
<p>
Settings include the name of the command (be sure to choose a name that isn't
already used) and a list of parameters. Parameters are what gets typed after
the command. For example, if you expect people to type <tt>/cheese Victim</tt>,
then the nickname is a parameter.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have between zero and five parameters.</li>
<li>Each parameter has to be given a name, with which you can refer to it in
the code. Names should be single words that don't use special characters, such
as <tt>nick</tt>.</li>
<li>For each parameter you can choose whether it should be text (<strong>String</strong>) or
a whole number (<strong>int</strong>). If the last parameter is a <strong>String</strong> then it includes all
the rest of the text typed. For example, if you have three <strong>String</strong> parameters and
the user types <tt>/command I am the tired man</tt>, then the parameters
will become "I", "am", and "the tired man" respectively.</li>
<li>leafChat will automatically give an error if somebody tries
to run a command without giving the right number or kind of parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Menu item</h3>
<p>
The <strong>Menu item</strong> item lets you add a new option which appears in
right-click menus when you click on a user or channel.
</p>
<p>
When you create the item you give it a name, which displays in the menu (can be
anything), and set whether you want it to apply for users, for channels, or only
when both a user and a channel is available.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on your 'Applies to' selection, one or both of the variables
<tt>nick</tt> and <tt>chan</tt> will be set up for use in your script code.</li>
<li>It is not currently possible within the scripting interface to create a menu 
item which applies to multiple users at once (i.e. if you select three people 
in the name list and right-click).</li>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Event</h3>
<p>
Using <strong>Event</strong> items, you can script reactions to things that 
happen on IRC, such as other users saying things.
</p>
<p>
A tree of available event types appears in the left of the settings window.
You can expand folders in this tree to find the type of event you want to 
respond to. For example, if you want to respond to users saying things in 
channels, that is under <tt>IRC/From user/Channel/Message</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Once you have chosen an event type, a brief description of that type appears
on the right along with a list of the variables that will become available for
your script. Some types also have filters which you can enable (for example,
if you only want to receive the event for a specific named channel).
</p>
<p>
Your script code then runs whenever the event happens.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced users may wish to know that in addition to the listed variables,
the <tt>msg</tt> variable is always provided. This is a message of the selected
event type. You'll need to use the <a href="../pluginapi/index.html">plugin API</a>
documentation to find out what extra information is available by calling Java
methods on that object. Note that the message names aren't exactly the same
as the names in the event type tree (they were renamed to make more sense for
display) but they do correspond exactly.</li>
<li>If you want to mark an event as 'handled', which indicates that you've
dealt with it and leafChat should not display it to the user, use the Java 
code line <tt>msg.markHandled();</tt> at the end of your code block.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Variable</h3>
<p>
<strong>Variable</strong> items define named variables that you can use to
store information, and can refer to from all other script items in the same
script.
</p>
<p>
Each variable needs a unique name which begins
with a lower-case letter, then includes any letters and numbers but no spaces or
symbols. For example,
<tt>tadpoleSize</tt> is a valid variable name.</p>
<p>You can choose the type of variable. <tt>String</tt> variables store text (words)
while <tt>int</tt> variables contain whole numbers. These behave differently if 
you try to do arithmetic: with <tt>int</tt>s, 2+2 is 4 but with <tt>String</tt>s,
"2"+"2" is "22" (and "tad"+"pole" is "tadpole"). Advanced users can use other Java types.</p>
<p>You can specify the initial value of a variable. If you don't specify it,
<tt>int</tt>s start at zero and <tt>String</tt>s start with "".</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial value applies whenever the script starts up, so you can't use
variables to store information between sessions. Variables will be reset
when leafChat starts, when you save a change to the script, or when you disable 
and enable the script.</li>
<li>You cannot refer to variables from different scripts. Variables are only
available within their own script.</li>
<li>If you specify a different Java type then you must use the full type name, 
except that <tt>java.lang</tt> is optional. Some examples: <tt>double</tt>, 
<tt>byte[]</tt>, <tt>Object</tt>, <tt>java.util.HashMap</tt>.</li>
<li>When using the 'Other' option the initial value is disabled; all variables
of this type begin at <tt>null</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
Here's an example of using events and variables. This is an advanced example
so you will need a small amount of programming experience in order to understand
it.
</p>
<p>
We're going to create a script
that watches out for people who yawn in channel by typing an action such as
<tt>/me yawns</tt>. Once three people have yawned, it sends a message to the
channel telling them to go to bed.
</p>
<ol>
<li>First we're going to need a variable that keeps track of the number of yawns.
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Add item</strong>, then choose <strong>Variable</strong> from
the dropdown.</li>
<li>Type in the name, <tt>yawns</tt>.</li>
<li>Select the type, <strong>int</strong>. We want this variable to store a 
number.</li>
<li>Although it's the default anyway, let's type in the initial value of <tt>0</tt>
just to be clear.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<li>Now let's create an event that detects channel actions.
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Add item</strong>, then choose <strong>Event</strong> from
the dropdown.</li>
<li>In the tree at the left, double-click on <strong>IRC</strong>, <strong>From user</strong>,
<strong>Channel</strong>, <strong>CTCP request</strong>, and finally click on <strong>Action</strong>. (Whew!)</li>
<li>Note the warning: events only operate on information received from the server,
not on things you send to it, which means you'll have to get somebody else to help if you want
to test this script.</li>
<li>Note also the list of variables that will be provided. The important ones are
<tt>sourceNick</tt> (that's the person who did the action) and <tt>text</tt> (that's
the text of the action, everything after /me).</li>
<li>Go ahead and click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Finally we need to write the actual script code for the action in the code box. 
This involves a mixture of IRC commands and Java code.
<pre>
if(text.indexOf("yawn")!=-1) yawns++;
if(yawns>2)
{
  /say ${sourceNick} (and others) - GO TO BED!
  yawns=0;
}
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The first line checks whether the <tt>text</tt> variable contains the word 'yawn'
(this will also cover 'yawns', 'yawning', etc). <i>variable</i><tt>.indexOf("</tt><i>something</i><tt>")!=-1</tt> 
looks horrible but is a pretty
standard way of checking whether a variable contains some text in Java.</li>
<li>If it does, then <tt>yawns++</tt> (equivalent
to <tt>yawns=yawns+1</tt>) means 'take the value of the <tt>yawns</tt> variable, 
add one to it, and set that back into the <tt>yawns</tt> variable again'.</li>
<li>The semicolon marks the end of that single-line <tt>if</tt> statement. In Java
you need semicolons at the end of each line of code except where it starts a multi-line 
block. However, don't use semicolons after IRC commands!</li>
<li>The next line begins a multi-line <tt>if</tt> statement. In this case we want 
to do two things so we need the multi-line version specifically, but in addition
to that you always need to use these if you want to incorporate IRC commands; 
IRC commands have to be on their own line.</li>
<li>This <tt>if</tt> checks whether <tt>yawns</tt> is now more than 2 (3 or greater).
The { symbol on the next line then indicates the beginning of the block of code
that will run if that test (<tt>yawns>2</tt>) passes.</li>
<li>An IRC command line then does <tt>/say</tt>. (Because this is a channel event, <tt>/say</tt>
will talk to the channel involved.) The <tt>${sourceNick}</tt> causes it to insert
the value of the <tt>sourceNick</tt> variable, i.e. the last person who yawned.</li>
<li>Because we don't want it to happen again right away, we then set the yawn count
back to zero. This is still within the { } symbols so it only happens if that
original test (<tt>yawns>2</tt>) was true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That's it! If you want to test it out, don't forget to save the script 
(and, if neccessary, enable it) first.</li>
</ol>
