<h1>leafChat scripts</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A script is a collection of customisations. You can use scripts to create 
new commands or to make your client automatically react to events.</p>
<h2>Script files</h2>
<p>Each script is a single file with a name ending in <strong>.leafChatScript</strong>. 
When a script is installed in leafChat, subsidiary files will include the compiled code 
or any errors.</p>
<p>Scripts are stored in the <strong>Scripts</strong> sub-folder of your <strong>per-user settings 
folder</strong>. You don't normally need to look in this folder as it is possible
to manage scripts within the application. (Currently it is not possible to make
scripts that apply to all users of a computer. Scripts are stored per-user.)</p>
<p>Script files are standard XML, so advanced users might want to examine or 
modify them using ordinary XML tools.</p>

<h2>Importing scripts</h2>
<p>If a friend has created a script you want to use, you should obtain from them
the <strong>.leafChatScript</strong> file. Then use the <strong>Import</strong>
button in the <strong>Scripting</strong> window to install the script into your
leafChat copy.</p>
<p>Scripts can <strong>damage your computer</strong> so be sure not to install 
scripts from any source you don't entirely trust.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
Scripts run inside leafChat on the same level as other parts of the program.
Some scripts can prevent standard functionality from working (intentionally
or by accident) or even cause the program to freeze or suddenly exit. Malicious
scripts could do much worse, such as delete all your files or install trojan
software to spy out your credit card number.
</p>

<p>
If you experience any bugs, try disabling all your scripts to see if this solves 
the problem. If a script prevents leafChat from starting up to the point where
you can disable it, find the script file on disk and delete it manually.
</p>

<h2>Creating new scripts</h2>
<h3>Intended audience</h3>
<p>
You need a degree of technical knowledge to create new scripts for 
leafChat &ndash; you don't have to be a programmer (unless you want to do the
advanced stuff) but you do need to be familiar with IRC.
