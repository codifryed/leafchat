The logs API provides methods that can be used to log data received on IRC
channels and in messages. Logged data is stored in files organised by date
and 'target' (channel or nickname) and is indexed for full-text search. The
files are automatically managed by archiving or deleting old logs.

<p>
This is not the API used for system logging, which goes to the systemlog.txt
file and is wiped each run of the program. Use log methods in
{@link leafchat.core.api.PluginContext} to log normal and debug status information for your plugin.
