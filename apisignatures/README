These API signature files contain lists of all the public classes and methods
in the API packages and also in the included 'util.jar' library. They are used
to check that leafChat maintains binary compatibility with plugins and user
scripts created for earlier versions.

To create API signature files for a particular version, run the 'makesignatures'
Ant target after setting 'sigbase' to point to a leafChat installation.

NOTE: In versions prior to 2.4, I manually edited the sig files to remove
the following line from 'util' Base64:

meth public final static void main(java.lang.String[])

This was removed in 2.4 release. There's no chance anything depended on it.
